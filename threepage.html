    <p>
      You are such an incredible person who I am so happy to know. You light up my life and I don't know what I'd do without such an amazing presence in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're so hardworking and I truly feel so lucky to know one of the best people in the whole world. You're kind, funny, sweet, and you always make sure that I'm doing alright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your overall personality always makes me feel seen. I want nothing but the best for you because that's what you deserve. As long as I can make you smile the same way you made me smile I'll be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please please please make sure to take care of yourself in college! I care about your health a lot and I WILL be checking in periodically to make sure you're doing good and also for all the latest gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been amazing knowing you for this long. I wouldn't have it any other way. Spending time with you has definitely become the thing I look the most forward to. I know you're going to thrive in college, and I can't wait to see what you do in the future. I know you're going to become the first ginger president or something.
    </p>
    <p>
     I look up to you, I care about you so much, and I want you to be happy. I trust you more than a lot of other people in my life. I'm super proud of you and all the work you have done in these shows, both on and off stage. Your singing is also super good, and I'm not just saying that.
    </p>
    <p>
     You are one of the coolest people I have ever known. You somehow make every room you walk into lighter without even trying, and each conversation with you is like a breath of fresh air. I know this is all so cheesy but I don't care. You deserve every word that I am typing right now. You're unapologetically yourself as well, and you don't bend your persoanlity to fit whoever you may be talking to. You make me want to be a better person all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this letter makes you realize just how incredible you are. I'm not saying all of this in a half-hearted or silly way. I mean every single word. From the bottom of my heart. You're the best. You always always make the lives of those around you infinitely better!!!!!!! Take care and thank you for all these years together!!!!!!!!!! Also thank your sister for all the photos teehee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love ya lots
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,<br>
Me
